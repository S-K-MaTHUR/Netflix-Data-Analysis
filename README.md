# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset** to uncover meaningful insights about content availability, genres, release trends, and ratings. Using Python and data analysis techniques, I explored the dataset to answer key business questions such as:

* What type of content (Movies vs. TV Shows) dominates the platform?
* Which countries contribute the most titles to Netflix?
* What are the most popular genres available?
* How has Netflix’s content library evolved over the years?

The aim of this project is to **demonstrate skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** while deriving insights that can help in strategic decision-making.
